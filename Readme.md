Evermark is a OSX application for previewing [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) notes using [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can read more about Evermark and hear its amazing jingle [here](http://writings.miguelregedor.com/evermark).


Installation
------------

Start by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/regedor/evermark/archive/v0.3.zip).

Unzip the file, copy the Evermark app to your applications folder and then open it. Simple!

Note: The app has a few dependencies that are downloaded on first time you open it (those are kept inside the app so that if you decide to delete it no rubbish is left). However, for this to work you will need to have xcode installed on your mac.
By default OSX comes with it but if you have never opened xcode you should go to the terminal and run the following command:

```
xcode-select --install
```
